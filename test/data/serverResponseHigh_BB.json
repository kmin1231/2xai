      "passage": "Baseball has many complex rules that govern the game. A key rule is the strike zone, which is the area over home plate between the batter's knees and the midpoint of their torso. A pitcher aims to throw the ball within this zone to get a strike. Additionally, there are rules regarding balks (illegal pitching movements), tag-ups (when a runner must return to their base before advancing), and interference (when a player illegally disrupts another player's play). These rules add strategic depth to the game.",

      "passage": "In advanced baseball, teams often use strategies to outsmart their opponents. For example, a defensive shift is when a team arranges its fielders in non-traditional positions based on a batter's hitting tendencies. Managers also use pitch counts to determine when to replace a pitcher, considering factors like fatigue and the number of pitches thrown. Another strategy is the hit-and-run play, where the batter swings as the runner steals a base. These strategies add layers of complexity to the game.",

        "What is the benefit of using a defensive shift?\nTo make the game more exciting\nTo increase the chance of getting a hit\nTo increase the chance of getting a double play\nTo prevent the batter from getting a hit by positioning fielders in expected locations\nNone of the above",

      "passage": "Baseball originated in the United States in the 19th century, evolving from older bat-and-ball games. It became formalized with the creation of the first professional league, the National Association of Base Ball Players, in 1871. The game continued to grow in popularity, leading to the formation of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1903. The sport has undergone many changes, such as the introduction of night games, the expansion of teams, and the breaking of racial barriers with players like Jackie Robinson.
