      "title": "What is Global Warming?",
      "passage": "Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. This process releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. As a result, ice caps melt, sea levels rise, and extreme weather events become more frequent.",

      "title": "Effects of Global Warming",
      "passage": "Global warming has a wide range of harmful effects on the environment. Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts are becoming more common. The rising temperatures also affect ecosystems, with many plants and animals struggling to adapt to the changes. Additionally, global warming leads to the loss of biodiversity as species are unable to survive in altered climates.",

      "title": "Fighting Global Warming",
      "passage": "Efforts to combat global warming include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, and promoting energy efficiency. Governments, businesses, and individuals can all play a role in these efforts. Many countries have committed to international agreements like the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. Reforestation, reducing waste, and using public transport instead of cars are also important actions that can help fight climate change.",
