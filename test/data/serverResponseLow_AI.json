      "passage": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or software that can think and learn like humans. AI can solve problems, make decisions, and even recognize patterns. Some common examples of AI include voice assistants like Siri, self-driving cars, and smart robots. AI is designed to help make tasks easier and more efficient, and it is used in many fields like medicine, education, and entertainment.",

      "title": "How Does AI Work?",
      "passage": "Artificial Intelligence works by using algorithms, which are sets of rules that help computers make decisions. These algorithms are trained with large amounts of data, allowing AI to learn and improve over time. For example, a self-driving car uses AI to recognize objects on the road by processing data from cameras and sensors. The more data AI gets, the better it can perform tasks. Machine learning, a type of AI, allows machines to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
